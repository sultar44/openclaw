Red Three's I understand you place out and gets counted towards your points.  What about the Black 3s.  On line they are used as blockers but nobody I know uses them that way.  They use them like the Red Three's.  What is the correct way?\nThanks!\n15 comments\nLike\nComment\nShare\nMost relevant\nAndi Stone Katz\nBoth color 3's are used the same way.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nEster Himelblum-Zeller replied\n1 Reply\n1h\nShelley Wohl Minsky\nRed or black 3s are counted in your points. Black 3s are not blockers. I don't know where you came up with that explanation.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nEster Himelblum-Zeller replied\n6 Replies\n1h\nHeidi Sue\nThose rules are over 50 years old! Forget about the blockers/ differences. All 3's are equal. Black or Red. 1 is 100 points. 2 are 300 points. 3 are 500 points. 4 are 1,000 points.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nBeth F. Levine\nIt looks like you got this info from a Google search or AI inquiry. It is wrong. Buy the book Modern American Canasta, written by main the moderators of this group. There are many variations between different groups. But I have never seen, in any game or explanation of Canasta, anything about black 3s being blockers. All 3s are laid on the table as points toward your base score. If your team has no Canastas, the 3s are negative points. If your team has 1 Canasta, the 3s are neutral, if you have 2 or more Canastas, your threes are counted positive towards your base score. The only time you would hold onto a 3 in your hand is if you are going for a straight, Special Hand (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K). Since the likelihood of getting such a Special Hand is very small, I have never seen anyone go for it, in my 5 years of playing. Because, if the game ends and you still have the 3 in your hand, you are penalized 100 points. Note, some game penalize only 5 points for a 3 left in hand at end of game.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nRoni Baronowitz\nThis is another version of canasta, not Modern American Canasta. It is not wrong or old, just another version often still played in the middle of the country, but not on the east coast.\n21m\nLike\nReply\nShare\nBrooke Nero\nI can safely say over 90 percent of the time when I was learning canasta I would get weird or totally inaccurate information from a google or AI search. Would recommend CLA pamphlet or Modern American canasta book will give you the correct info on how canasta is played now. This facebook group is also a great place to get most rules.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nBeverly Diamond\nI have been playing canasta for decades and have never heard of a 3 being a blocker. There is a game called Samba (similar to canasta) or Hand & foot which does have that rule.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare\nJodi Lieberman Most\nWhat is a blocker? Never heard of that term.\n1h\nLike\nReply\nShare"
