## Issues
- **Gateway security error** — OpenClaw CLI rejects `ws://192.168.68.200:18789` (non-loopback plaintext). This blocks `openclaw cron list`, the watchdog script, and daily audit. Ramon needs to either switch to `wss://` or use a localhost tunnel. This has been happening since at least last night.
