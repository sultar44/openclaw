## Summary
Mostly automated cron activity — the Facebook Canasta scraper backup job fired **hundreds of times** in rapid succession overnight, each time verifying the same already-captured posts. No substantive user interactions found.

## Issues
- **Facebook scraper backup cron was misconfigured** — ran ~650+ times in one night instead of once. Each run verified MAC/CL groups were already scraped, found nothing new, and exited. Massive token waste.

## Canasta Strategy Database
- Strategy entries at ~117 lines in strategy.jsonl
- Groups status: MAC (44 posts), CL (12 posts), CCG (1 post), NYMC (0 posts), CPG (awaiting approval)
- One new entry added across all runs: **FB033** (Shoshana Fluss Pilevsky — etiquette about checking closed canastas for wild card counts)
