## Key Decisions & Actions

### LLM Changes
- Ramon switched **heartbeat LLM** to `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` (Gemini Flash)
- Ramon switched **main LLM** to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` (from openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex)

### Kajabi → Klaviyo Integration (Completed!)
- Long hands-on session helping Ramon wire up Google Apps Script to subscribe Kajabi form leads into Klaviyo
- Key issues solved:
  - `POST /api/profiles/` fails when profile exists → switched to `profile-subscription-bulk-create-jobs` endpoint (upsert + subscribe in one call)
  - Kajabi nests email under `payload.payload.Email` (not top-level) → added broad email extraction
  - `properties` field rejected by bulk subscribe endpoint → removed, used separate PATCH for custom props
  - Script Properties vs hardcoded values confusion → guided Ramon through Apps Script Project Settings
  - Debug visibility: webhook returns go to caller (Kajabi), not Apps Script UI → added `LAST_DEBUG` property + `readLastDebug()` helper
- Final working flow: Kajabi form → Apps Script webhook → subscribe to Klaviyo list → lookup profile → PATCH name + custom properties
- **Successfully tested end-to-end** ✅

### Cron Job Changes
- **Stopped daily strategy report emails** — Ramon said reviewing on website is enough
- Facebook group scan rotation: MAC, CCG, CL, NYMC active; CPG awaiting approval

### Sales Data Analysis
- Ramon asked about best-selling products with multiple units per order
- A7S-CAN2P has highest multi-unit rate: **17.5%** of orders are qty 2+
- Cross-SKU bundle analysis available (same order ID grouping)

### Business Discussions
- **Next project after COGS**: Competitor monitoring (then FBA reimbursement, deep product research)
- **OpenAI ads**: Recommended small capped test only, not primary channel — wait for platform maturity
- **Canasta landing page review** (canastacourse.com): Gave CRO feedback — hero clarity, social proof, CTA optimization, FAQ section

### Preferences
- **Message chunking rule confirmed**: Split responses over 800 characters into multiple messages (Slack crops long ones)
- Ramon prefers short numbered chunks for code/instructions

## Routine Cron
- All data collection jobs ran normally
- Biweekly Platform Health Council audit ran (found cron timeout issues, dependency vulnerabilities, missing tests)
