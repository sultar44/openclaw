# February 27, 2026 - Daily Log

## Heartbeat Audit (05:17 AM EST)
- Checked all enabled cron jobs (25 total).
- Reviewed recent runs for each job via `openclaw cron runs`.
- **Finding:** No job has exceeded 10 runs in the last 2 hours. Most active jobs are on daily/weekly schedules and have run 0-1 times today.
- **Status:** OK. No runaway processes detected.

## Cron Infrastructure Overhaul (Major — All Day)

### ClickUp Integration Improvements
- **`clickup_integration.py` updated**: On success, now posts comment → marks complete → reopens as "to do" with next due date calculated from cron schedule
- **All 25 ClickUp task descriptions updated** with: intent, schedule, cron ID, script/playbook path, and outcome link
- **ClickUp API limitation discovered**: Recurrence can't be set via API (UI-only). Script's "complete → reopen with next date" achieves the same result

### Google Drive Integration (New Capability)
- **Drive API enabled** for Chloe via Ramon's Google Cloud project (`lustrous-bounty-460801-b9`)
- Created custom OAuth client (Desktop app) in Ramon's project since gog's default project (846405943556) isn't accessible
- Added `chloemercer32@gmail.com` as test user in OAuth consent screen
- **Switched gog from macOS Keychain to file-based keyring** to avoid SecurityAgent popup issues
- **36 collector scripts + 4 playbooks uploaded** to Google Drive folder (`12VT05MxKuhnQsshweYkyxvRVQ47kx3A0`) in `Cron Scripts` and `Playbooks` subfolders
- Ramon shared Drive folder with `chloemercer32@gmail.com` as Editor

### New Cron Job: Drive Skill Sync
- **Script**: `~/amazon-data/collectors/drive_skill_sync.py`
- **Schedule**: Nightly 11 PM EST (before overnight jobs)
- **ClickUp task**: <https://app.clickup.com/t/86ewrh6e5>
- Compares local skill files to Drive copies, pushes newer local files to Drive
- Internal files are always source of truth; Drive stays current for Ramon to review
- Initial sync seeded all 27 skill files

### Skill File Corrections Found During Review
- **Facebook Canasta Scraper**: Was incorrectly set to "ONE group per run, rotating" — corrected to scrape ALL groups every run
- **Weekly Listing Optimization**: Was CA marketplace only — corrected to process both US and CA
- **Wholesale Pricing Report**: SKILL.md mentioned eBay sync but script doesn't do it — removed eBay reference (Option 1: match reality)
- **Daily Product Master Sync**: Clarified direction is Sheet → SQLite (never reverse)
- **Buybox Price Checker**: Clarified it fetches Buy Box *price* (not ownership), targets "Por Vender" sheet not wholesale sheet
- **Product Master Sync**: Fixed sheet ID (old one was trashed), switched from public CSV download to service account API access. New sheet: `1MUcmj4mqz-N5QSRFpqrbFUOTX33EKo85CDoaAXuuSGs`
- **OpenClaw Auto-Update**: Updated delivery routing — ClickUp gets status, #chloe-logs gets recommendations only

### Cron Job Health
- 8 jobs disabled by watchdog at 5:19 AM due to consecutive timeouts/delivery errors
- All 10 recurring jobs re-enabled after Ramon's review
- 3 one-time jobs left disabled (Facebook Scraper Toni, Immediate log delivery test, Remind Ramon DataForSEO)
- **Wholesale Pricing Report timed out** at 273/341 ASINs during offer price fetch — needs longer timeout or batch reduction
- **Daily PPC Collection partial failure**: US campaigns (229 rows) and keywords (1,527 rows) succeeded, but search terms and CA reports didn't complete

### ClickUp Logging Compliance Issue
- All cron payloads already include `clickup_integration.py` call — the wiring is complete
- Real issue: isolated AI sessions sometimes skip the ClickUp step (execution compliance, not config)
- Ramon approved Option 1: wrap Python scripts to auto-call ClickUp (remove AI from the loop for logging)

## Vine Orders Processed
- **Row 117**: Leadfan Car Radio for Honda Civic 2006-2011 (B0GF7Z5S94, $110.00, Order 111-2250328-7056260)
- **Row 118**: HOUSE REFLECTION LED Bathroom Mirror (B0FHDYJMR9, $181.73, Order 111-7833546-6918630)

## Content
- **The Better Hand** email draft ready for Friday Feb 27: "Why You'd Throw a Card You Already Have" — strategy about protecting the pack vs growing melds
- **Sunday Ritual** first draft ready: story of Josefina Artayeta de Viel bringing Canasta from Buenos Aires to NYC in 1948

## Slack Profile
- Ramon asked about updating Chloe's Slack profile picture from red meeple to actual picture
- Bot tokens can't change profile photos — requires user token with `users.profile:write` scope

## Ramon's Preferences/Decisions
- Ramon wants ClickUp to be his source of truth for cron job status (with comments, no overdue dates)
- Changing ClickUp task titles/descriptions won't affect Chloe's behavior (tasks found by ID in config)
- Ramon approved: skill file changes should flow from internal → Drive nightly (not the reverse for now)
- Ramon wants Google Drive links in ClickUp descriptions (not local file paths) so he can review from any device
- AGENTS.md updated with rule: act immediately on runaway/wasteful cron jobs, inform after (don't ask permission)
