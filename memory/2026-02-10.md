## Strategy Extraction Complete

Extracted **38 strategy tips** from Tips & Tricks doc and added to `strategy.jsonl`:
- Hand management, discarding, closing decisions, pack protection
- Partner communication, tournament play, endgame tactics
- All marked `status: "approved"` (internal docs)

Total in strategy.jsonl: **69 entries**
- 38 approved (tips_doc)
- 31 from Facebook (23 pending, 8 unknown status)

## Email Spam Issue - FIXED

Ramon reported receiving:
- 13 "test from Chloe" emails over 10 hours
- 16 "Facebook Canasta Scraper Results" emails

**Root cause:** Cron job running repeatedly, sending emails each run.

**Fix applied:**
- Removed problematic cron job
- Created proper schedule with NO per-run emails
- Single daily report at 7am only

## New Cron Jobs Created

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Daily Strategy Report | 7:00 AM | Email ALL pending entries (single daily email) |
| Facebook Canasta Scraper | 10:30 PM | Continue scraping, NO emails |

## Strategy Management Tool

Created `manage_strategy.py` in `canasta-rules/`:
- `pending` - list pending entries
- `show <ID>` - view full entry
- `approve <ID>` - approve entry
- `reject <ID>` - reject entry
- `remove <ID>` - delete permanently
- `approve-source <source>` - bulk approve by source
- `report` - generate email report

## Facebook Scraper Progress

- Only got ~1 week of posts (31 entries)
- Target: reach 1/10/2026 (1 month back)
- Will continue nightly at 10:30 PM
- State tracked in `scrape_state.json`

## Key Lesson Learned

**Email discipline for cron jobs:**
- No test emails unless debugging specific issue
- No per-run reports
- Single consolidated daily report
- Silent operation unless errors
