# 2026-02-25 — Daily Memory

## SEO & Blog Articles
- **7 existing Canasta articles locked in** — no more changes except adding internal links for new articles
- Fixed "7 Canasta Mistakes" article background color (had `background: #fff` forcing white instead of theme's bone/off-white)
- FAQ article fully reorganized into 8 topic categories with colored section headings (#2d5a3d dark green)
- Removed controversial wild card discard/freeze Q&A per Ramon's decision (community divided on this)
- **Rule: No em dashes anywhere in content** — Ramon is firm on this

## Scoring Guide Draft
- Article ID: 618191814939, Blog ID: 118728917275
- Title: "Canasta Scoring Guide & Point Values - The Complete Reference"
- ~3,200 words with 8 HTML scoring tables
- Ran through humanizer skill — AI score 30/100 ("Probably Human")
- Status: Draft, awaiting Ramon's review
- Removed 35 em dashes, cleaned AI patterns

## Humanizer Skill
- **Reinstalled from ClawHub**: `operator-humanizer` at `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/operator-humanizer/`
- Originally audited and approved by Ramon on Feb 16 but install was lost between sessions
- Monthly cron exists (`bee87903`) to update skill from Wikipedia "Signs of AI Writing" page — hasn't run yet (idle)
- **Rule: ALL blog/script content must run through humanizer before Ramon reviews**
- JS analysis tool: `node skills/operator-humanizer/scripts/humanize.js analyze -f <file>`

## DataForSEO Setup
- Credentials saved to `~/amazon-data/.env` (login: ramon@goven.com)
- Budget wrapper built at `collectors/dataforseo_api.py`
- **Caps: $5 first day, $0.50/day after, $10 minimum balance floor**
- Usage tracked in `~/amazon-data/dataforseo_usage.json`
- Total spent today: $0.165

## SEO Keyword Research (Baseline)
- Pulled search volumes for 47 Canasta keywords
- Saved to `~/amazon-data/seo_keywords_baseline.json`
- Top keywords: "canasta rules" (12,100/mo), "how to play canasta" (6,600/mo), "canasta scoring" (880/mo)
- SERP baseline: all7s.co ranks for ZERO keywords in top 100 (starting from scratch)
- Google has 78 pages indexed for all7s.co — indexation is fine, issue is domain authority
- **Decision: Skip DataForSEO SERP tracking cron for now** — GSC Weekly Report (Monday, 9AM) already exists. Will add SERP tracker once we start seeing impressions.

## Memory System
- **Nightly Memory Digest cron created** (11 PM EST) — parses session transcripts, writes to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- **Weekly Memory Consolidation cron created** (Sunday 10 AM) — promotes important items to MEMORY.md
- Script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/automation/nightly_memory.py`
- 1,078 existing session transcript files in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`
- Lesson: Previous sessions' skill installs and decisions were invisible because nothing was logged to memory files

## Existing Cron Jobs Noted
- GSC Weekly Report: Mondays 9 AM (Google Search Console data)
- Monthly Humanizer Skill Update: 4th of month, 10 PM (idle, never run)
