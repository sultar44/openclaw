# 2026-02-25 — Daily Memory

## SEO & Blog Articles
- **7 existing Canasta articles locked in** — no more changes except adding internal links for new articles
- Fixed "7 Canasta Mistakes" article background color (had `background: #fff` forcing white instead of theme's bone/off-white)
- FAQ article fully reorganized into 8 topic categories with colored section headings (#2d5a3d dark green)
- Removed controversial wild card discard/freeze Q&A per Ramon's decision (community divided on this)
- **Rule: No em dashes anywhere in content** — Ramon is firm on this

## Scoring Guide Draft
- Article ID: 618191814939, Blog ID: 118728917275
- Title: "Canasta Scoring Guide & Point Values - The Complete Reference"
- ~3,200 words with 8 HTML scoring tables
- Ran through humanizer skill — AI score 30/100 ("Probably Human")
- Status: Draft, awaiting Ramon's review
- Removed 35 em dashes, cleaned AI patterns

## Humanizer Skill
- **Reinstalled from ClawHub**: `operator-humanizer` at `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/operator-humanizer/`
- Originally audited and approved by Ramon on Feb 16 but install was lost between sessions
- Monthly cron exists (`bee87903`) to update skill from Wikipedia "Signs of AI Writing" page — hasn't run yet (idle)
- **Rule: ALL blog/script content must run through humanizer before Ramon reviews**
- JS analysis tool: `node skills/operator-humanizer/scripts/humanize.js analyze -f <file>`

## DataForSEO Setup
- Credentials saved to `~/amazon-data/.env` (login: ramon@goven.com)
- Budget wrapper built at `collectors/dataforseo_api.py`
- **Caps: $5 first day, $0.50/day after, $10 minimum balance floor**
- Usage tracked in `~/amazon-data/dataforseo_usage.json`
- Total spent today: $0.165

## SEO Keyword Research (Baseline)
- Pulled search volumes for 47 Canasta keywords
- Saved to `~/amazon-data/seo_keywords_baseline.json`
- Top keywords: "canasta rules" (12,100/mo), "how to play canasta" (6,600/mo), "canasta scoring" (880/mo)
- SERP baseline: all7s.co ranks for ZERO keywords in top 100 (starting from scratch)
- Google has 78 pages indexed for all7s.co — indexation is fine, issue is domain authority
- **Decision: Skip DataForSEO SERP tracking cron for now** — GSC Weekly Report (Monday, 9AM) already exists. Will add SERP tracker once we start seeing impressions.

## Memory System
- **Nightly Memory Digest cron created** (11 PM EST) — parses session transcripts, writes to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- **Weekly Memory Consolidation cron created** (Sunday 10 AM) — promotes important items to MEMORY.md
- Script: `~/.openclaw/workspace/automation/nightly_memory.py`
- 1,078 existing session transcript files in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`
- Lesson: Previous sessions' skill installs and decisions were invisible because nothing was logged to memory files

## Existing Cron Jobs Noted
- GSC Weekly Report: Mondays 9 AM (Google Search Console data)
- Monthly Humanizer Skill Update: 4th of month, 10 PM (idle, never run)

## Evening Session — Infrastructure Audit & Improvements

### What happened
- Ramon watched a Matthew Berman OpenClaw video and asked me to compare our setup
- Led to a full gap analysis and several action items

### Decisions made
- ✅ Created `lessons-learned.md` — capturing from today forward, no backfill
- ✅ Commitment audit completed via sub-agent — read full #chloebot Slack history (Feb 16-25)
- Results: 20 delivered, real gaps are only content idea DB (not ready) and Klaviyo (API key tomorrow)
- Backups confirmed working: git auto-sync (nightly) + SQLite→GDrive (nightly, encrypted, 7-day rotation)
- Email trigger system (Amazon order→sheet) was miscategorized as missing — it's built and working
- Dropped launchd fallback expansion — self-heal cron covers the same need better
- #chloe-logs stays as-is — Ramon wants visibility right now
- Self-heal cron to be built tonight

### Action items
- [ ] Build morning self-heal cron (review overnight errors, retry or alert)
- [ ] Klaviyo API integration (Ramon providing key tomorrow)
- [ ] Content idea database (when Ramon is ready)

## Shopify API Integration
- **Store URL:** `boardgamefun.myshopify.com`
- Shopify custom app "Chloe CMS" created with `read_content, write_content` scopes
- New auth flow: client credentials exchange (refreshes every 24h) — NOT the old static Admin API token
- Credentials (Client ID + Client Secret) saved to `~/amazon-data/.env` as `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` / `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Utility built at `~/amazon-data/collectors/shopify_api.py` — handles token auto-refresh, can list/create/update articles
- Both blogs visible: all7s-games (10 articles) + travel-tales-games (38 articles)
- Ramon's preference: keep content app (write) and future chatbot app (read-only) as **separate Shopify apps** for security

## SEO Fixes Applied (All Live)
- Fixed duplicate H1 tags across **44 articles** (both blogs)
- Fixed 2 broken internal links (`/blogs/nerkin-games/` → `/blogs/all7s-games/`)
- Added Canasta course CTAs to all 7 Canasta articles (link: canastacourse.com, NOT teachable)
- Added "Related Articles" internal linking sections to all 7 Canasta articles (6 sibling links each)
- Added FAQ schema markup (JSON-LD FAQPage) with 46 Q&A pairs
- Added 28 new Q&As from rules knowledge base (strategy.jsonl), organized by 8 categories
- Canasta Scoring Guide published (article #8) and internal links added from all other 7 articles
- FAQ article Q&A styling: dark green (#2d5a3d) section headings with bottom border
- **Rules:** Only one CTA per article (at top), only one product image per article (at bottom, newest version)

## FBA Restock Forecast Improvements
- **Seasonal factor removed** — was distorting forecasts (Feb 2025 anomaly dragged down current projections)
- **Inbound now includes FC transfers** — uses `GET_FBA_INVENTORY_PLANNING_DATA` report from SP-API
- **AWD inventory integrated** — reads from Inventory_Counts Google Sheet, converts cartons to units
- **3PL inventory integrated** — reads all 3PL locations from Inventory_Counts sheet (Tactical, ShipDepot, Miami, Meijia CN, Sourcing_Pioneer)
- **CAN2P units_per_carton fixed** — was 86 in DB, actually 40. Changed "Order by Apr 1" → "ORDER NOW"
- Velocity functions now anchor to latest available data date (not today) — eliminates phantom empty days
- Created `~/amazon-data/collectors/restock_config.json` for alert filtering:
  - A7S-HWC: alerts disabled (seasonal Q4)
  - Non-All7s brands: US-only
  - All7s brands: US + CA
- **FBA Restock Alert cron**: Mon & Thu 9 AM → #ops_amazon (CF9T43YMQ), timeout 600s

## PO Forecast Rebuild
- Complete rewrite of `forecast_restock.py` PO_Forecast tab
- **Inventory breakdown**: FBA US | FBA CA | AWD | 3PL US | 3PL CN | Inbound → Total
- **6-month forecast**: Auto (40% YoY + 60% recent 30-day) + Manual Override + Final columns
- **Manual override support**: type a number in any Override column, system uses it instead of auto-calc
- **Kit component demand** factored into monthly burn
- **Stockout date** calculated via daily drawdown
- **Suggested PO in both units and cartons**
- B2B carton variants (e.g. A7S-CAN2P-12) treated as same ASIN inventory, just different packaging

## Listing Monitor Improvements
- **Coupon detection bug fixed** — was treating any coupon history as active; now checks actual value
- **Discount scraping added** — scrapes Amazon product pages for multi-buy promotions ("Save X% on 2 items")
- Runs on Sunday for Monday report; adds "Discount" column to sheet
- Result: 11 ASINs have active discounts (10% or 5%), 4 without (all expected: seasonal/discontinued)
- **Monday listing monitor delivery fixed** — was going to #chloe-logs instead of #ops_amazon; corrected to CF9T43YMQ

## Cron Delivery Issue (Recurring)
- Overnight cron jobs show `deliveryStatus: "delivered"` but messages never reach #chloe-logs
- Gateway logs: "Recovery time budget exceeded — 3 entries deferred to next restart"
- Same issue happened Feb 20-21, was fixed by restart, broke again
- Not all crons affected — AWD job delivers fine
- **Root cause:** Gateway-level bug, OpenClaw marks delivery as succeeded but Slack doesn't receive

## Klaviyo Integration
- Ramon asked if Chloe can push "The Better Hand" email drafts directly to Klaviyo as campaigns
- Klaviyo has full API for this (Templates API + Campaigns API)
- **Action item: Ramon providing Klaviyo Private API Key tomorrow (Feb 26)**
- Cron reminder set for 9 AM to ask for the key

## Better Hand Email
- Weekly email draft created for Friday Feb 27
- Strategy ID used: ST008 (Discard for defense — throw a card you already melded)
- PS type: course (rotation: course → social → engagement)
- Logged to `playbooks/better-hand-log.jsonl`

## Facebook Canasta Scraper
- Scraped Modern American Canasta (MAC) group tonight
- 3 new entries: FB050, FB051, FB052
- Running totals: 136 entries in strategy.jsonl, 60 from MAC

## Wholesale Pricing Report
- 2 successful Amazon repricings: 7779T-NAVY-XS → $31.71, 7777T-WINE-XS → $36.77

## Infrastructure Audit (Sub-agent)
- Full audit of #chloebot history (Feb 16-25) completed
- 27 total commitments found: 20 delivered, 4 missing, 3 partial
- Missing: email trigger system (actually exists), content idea DB (not ready), Klaviyo (tomorrow), launchd fallbacks (dropped)
- Lessons-learned.md created for ongoing capture
