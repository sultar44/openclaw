- Ramon confirmed all listing optimization cron jobs are working from the same sheet (`1z7WGoXHJ-k2K72wUmp5VU81h37wKaKyqcf9F5cwy_2s`).
- Critical implementation rule for all sheet-writing tasks: always resolve target columns by header name, never static column letters, because columns will continue to shift during development.
- Correction noted: `Fee_Estimate` is now intended for column M (not L). Column L was shifted after a new column was added.
- Implemented hardening in `~/amazon-data/collectors/listing_monitor.py`: all read/write columns now resolve by header names (not static letters), updates use single-cell header-mapped writes, and a safety check prevents writing to protected static columns (`List_Price`, `ideal_price`, `COGS`) if mappings ever overlap.
