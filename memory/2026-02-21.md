## Key Decisions & Actions

### Gateway Fix
- Fixed gateway config: changed from `ws://192.168.68.200:18789` (LAN) to `127.0.0.1:18789` (loopback) — resolved security block that was breaking cron watchdog, CLI commands, and causing agent timeouts
- Installed LaunchAgent for gateway persistence across reboots

### Cron Notification Fix
- Cron jobs were running but announce notifications to #chloe-logs were failing (`cron announce delivery failed`) due to device auth pairing/permission mismatch
- Fixed device auth state and patched all 23 cron jobs with explicit Slack target format

### Email-Triggered Jobs (Major New Feature)
- Ramon requested **email-triggered automation** (forward emails to chloemercer32@gmail.com → trigger jobs)
- Set up full Gmail Pub/Sub webhook pipeline:
  - Installed gcloud CLI
  - Configured `gog` OAuth credentials for chloemercer32@gmail.com (Gmail + Sheets)
  - Set up Tailscale (free plan) for public push endpoint
  - Created Gmail webhook trigger with security: sender allowlist (goven.com/all7s.co), domain filtering
- **First job**: Amazon order email → parse → append row to Google Sheet (Por Vender tab)
  - Test successful: parsed order #113-2978867-4604264 from thehouse@goven.com
- Removed duplicate/test hook (`gmail_amazon_order.js`) that was firing confusing test payloads

### Mission Control Updates
- Updated cron view at localhost:8888/cron to **rolling 7-day window** (starts today, shifts daily)
- Port 8765 fully decommissioned

### Wholesale Sheet Sorting
- Updated `update_wholesale_sheet.py` to sort by ASIN (group SKUs together), then by inventory descending within each ASIN
- `bsr_checker.py` already fetches Keepa once per ASIN and skips zero-qty ASINs

### Vine Review Writer Fix
- Ramon noted job fails when no reviews to write — updated with **fast preflight** (reads F/S/T/U via CSV) and exits immediately with "No qualifying rows" instead of timing out

### Copag Competitor Research
- Deep research on Copag (card game competitor, much larger)
- Key insight: Don't compete on generic "best playing cards" — compete on **emotional use-case + community outcome**
- **Plastic cards** identified as major product opportunity — Ramon should test plastic Canasta line (2-pack and 6-pack) as tiered offer

### Newsletter Strategy
- Ramon wants to centralize everything in **Klaviyo** (Kajabi for course delivery only)
- Defined 4 Klaviyo profile properties: source, intent, customer_status, engagement_level
- **Best email day from sales data: Friday** ($549.93 avg/day for Canasta SKUs)
- Sent full newsletter strategy to ramon@goven.com

### Operational Rules
- Google Sheets writes: always use service account (`openclaw-sheets@...`) — saved to TOOLS.md

### Content Idea Bank
- Ramon wants a **production-first idea bank** for content about "reinventing yourself after 50"
- Proposed structure: idea title, audience pain/emotion, format fit, hook, proof source, angle for All7s, CTA path

## Routine Cron
- FBA Inventory US hit FATAL + CA rate-limited (both days) — orders collected fine
- All other cron jobs (ranks, sales, AWD, BSR, wholesale) ran normally
- GSC weekly report ran multiple duplicate times (cron issue)
