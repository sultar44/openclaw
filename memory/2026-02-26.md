## ClickUp Migration (Major)

### Chloe Joined ClickUp
- Created ClickUp account for chloemercer32@gmail.com via browser signup
- Accepted invite to Goven workspace from Ramon
- Chloe user ID: 107688256

### Cron Jobs → ClickUp Tasks
- Created "Chloe Automated Tasks" list in **BIZ: Corporate** (list ID: 901816342276)
- Migrated all 25 cron jobs + 3 launchd tasks = **28 tasks total**
- Each task assigned to Chloe Mercer with due dates matching schedules
- Categories: Data Collection (11), Analytics (5), Content (4), System (5+3), Marketing (1)

### Integration Layer Built
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/clickup_integration.py` — posts comments + updates status
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/clickup_config.json` — cron ID → ClickUp task ID mapping
- **New logging protocol:**
  - Success → ClickUp comment only (no Slack)
  - Partial failure → ClickUp comment + #chloe-logs
  - Critical failure → ClickUp comment + #chloebot

### Files Updated
- TOOLS.md — added ClickUp section, updated cron logging rules
- HEARTBEAT.md — updated watchdog to include ClickUp comments
- Chloe ClickUp password: Canasta7Games!2026

### Cron Delivery Config Updated (DONE)
- All 25 cron jobs updated: 21 switched from #chloe-logs → `none` (ClickUp only)
- 4 jobs kept special delivery: Better Hand Draft & Sunday Ritual Draft → #chloebot, Listing Monitor & FBA Restock → #all7s-alerts (CF9T43YMQ)
- All 25 now have ClickUp logging instructions appended to payload with correct cron ID

### Still TODO
- Set proper ClickUp recurring task schedules (API due dates set, but recurrence needs ClickUp UI)

## Better Hand Email #3 — "When to Hold Pairs"

### Strategy Workflow Decision
- **New process:** Ramon feeds strategy tips → Chloe writes the email copy. Ramon is the strategy brain, Chloe is the content machine.
- First tip from Ramon: "Keep pairs in hand which allow you to pick the pack. Get rid of pairs if they've already been melded with 5+ cards as they're safe."
- Draft created, Ramon reviewed and edited for accuracy
- **Coupon code:** CANASTA10 (permanent, replaces FRIDAY10)
- **Store URL:** Amazon storefront link with attribution tag (locked in for all future emails)
- **Sign-off:** "Warmly, Ramon" (matching welcome sequence)
- Klaviyo draft campaign created: "Better Hand #3 - When to Hold Pairs", scheduled Fri Feb 27, 9:00 AM

### Better Hand Playbook Updated
- Coupon, store URL, and sign-off locked in for all future emails

## Sunday Ritual Email Series (NEW)

### Concept & Decisions
- New weekly email series: "The Sunday Ritual" — stories about women who built connection on purpose
- **Two pillars:** Famous women (15 figures) + Ritual themes (15 topics) from the 30-day social content scripts PDF
- **No selling** in Sunday Ritual — this is the community/connection email (Better Hand is the strategy/commerce one)
- Email #1 intro paragraph frames the series; subsequent emails use shorter opener
- **Evergreen flow** (not weekly campaigns) — every new subscriber gets #1 first, then one per week
- Klaviyo API can't create flows — flow building is UI-only. Chloe creates templates + blog posts, Ramon adds them to the flow in Klaviyo UI

### Julia Child — First Email + Blog Post
- Email + blog post drafted for Julia Child ("She Set the Table")
- Blog post created in Shopify as draft with images from Wikimedia Commons
- Course CTA tied to the gathering theme: "If Julia's story made you want to set a night..."
- **Image hosting SOP established:** Permanent hidden Shopify article (ID: 618201022747, "Image Host - Do Not Delete") for hosting inline blog images on CDN

### Image Lessons Learned
- Wikimedia filenames are unreliable — always verify images with vision before uploading
- Shopify doesn't render base64 inline images — must upload to CDN first
- Deleting the temp hosting article kills CDN URLs — hence permanent Image Host article
- Blog headers should always be horizontal/landscape (3:2 or 16:9)
- Same image for both email and blog header (one image, two uses)

### Email Image SOP
- Width: 600px, height: 300-400px, <100KB, JPG, 72 DPI, 3:2 or 16:9 landscape
- Blog header: 1200px wide, 3:2 ratio, <200KB
- Blog inline: 800-1000px, <150KB

### Top 5 Picks from Content Scripts PDF
1. Julia Child ⭐ (done)
2. Elizabeth Montagu
3. The Sunday Dinner (#18)
4. Betty White
5. Eleanor Roosevelt

### Sunday Ritual Cron Draft (also ran today)
- Drafted email about Josefina Artayeta de Viel (woman who brought Canasta to America in 1948)
- This was auto-generated by the Sunday Ritual Draft cron — needs Ramon's review

## Google Drive ↔ Workspace Sync (NEW)

### Setup Complete
- Bidirectional sync script: `gdrive_sync.py`
- Uses service account (`openclaw-sheets@lustrous-bounty-460801-b9.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
- Syncs to "AI" shared drive → "Chloe Brain/" folder
- Structure: `workspace/` (7 .md files) + `skills/` (skill files)
- Hourly sync via launchd plist
- MD5 hash tracking for change detection, last-write-wins on conflicts

### 25 Skill Files Created
- Sub-agent wrote SKILL.md for all 25 cron jobs under `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`
- Each documents: purpose, schedule, execution commands, behavior rules, error handling, alerts, dependencies
- Ramon will review from Drive tomorrow

## Amazon Reimbursement Tool (Discussion)
- Ramon interested in building an FBA reimbursement case creation tool
- Option B (internal API interception) chosen as approach — intercept Seller Central XHR endpoints
- Plan: recon phase (capture endpoints) → build engine → test with known cases
- Not started yet, just discussed

---

- Daily Amazon Data Collection → 900s timeout
- Daily Rank Collection → 900s timeout

- Updated AGENTS.md with this rule

- CLICKUP_API_KEY added to ~/amazon-data/.env
