## ClickUp Migration (Major)

### Chloe Joined ClickUp
- Created ClickUp account for chloemercer32@gmail.com via browser signup
- Accepted invite to Goven workspace from Ramon
- Chloe user ID: 107688256

### Cron Jobs → ClickUp Tasks
- Created "Chloe Automated Tasks" list in **BIZ: Corporate** (list ID: 901816342276)
- Migrated all 25 cron jobs + 3 launchd tasks = **28 tasks total**
- Each task assigned to Chloe Mercer with due dates matching schedules
- Categories: Data Collection (11), Analytics (5), Content (4), System (5+3), Marketing (1)

### Integration Layer Built
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/clickup_integration.py` — posts comments + updates status
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/clickup_config.json` — cron ID → ClickUp task ID mapping
- **New logging protocol:**
  - Success → ClickUp comment only (no Slack)
  - Partial failure → ClickUp comment + #chloe-logs
  - Critical failure → ClickUp comment + #chloebot

### Files Updated
- TOOLS.md — added ClickUp section, updated cron logging rules
- HEARTBEAT.md — updated watchdog to include ClickUp comments
- Chloe ClickUp password: Canasta7Games!2026

### Still TODO
- Update each cron job's delivery config to stop announcing to #chloe-logs on success
- Wire clickup_integration.py calls into each cron job's execution flow
- Set proper ClickUp recurring task schedules (API due dates set, but recurrence needs ClickUp UI or further API work)
