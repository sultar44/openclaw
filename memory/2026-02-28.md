## 🛠️ Daily Cron Audit (5:00 AM EST)
Completed the daily cron audit. Detected and disabled three runaway jobs that exceeded the 10-run-per-2-hour threshold.

- **Daily Amazon Data Collection** (ccccea64...): 32 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.
- **Daily Sales & Traffic Collection** (23299316...): 28 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.
- **AWD Inventory Sheet Update** (816033d3...): 25 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.

Alerted Ramon in #chloebot. These jobs likely timed out (consecutive errors in state) and were being retried too aggressively by the scheduler or internal retry logic.

## 🔄 Cron Watchdog
Ran the watchdog. No missed jobs detected at 5:10 AM.
