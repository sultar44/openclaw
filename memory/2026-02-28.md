## 🛠️ Daily Cron Audit (5:00 AM EST)
Completed the daily cron audit. Detected and disabled three runaway jobs that exceeded the 10-run-per-2-hour threshold.

- **Daily Amazon Data Collection** (ccccea64...): 32 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.
- **Daily Sales & Traffic Collection** (23299316...): 28 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.
- **AWD Inventory Sheet Update** (816033d3...): 25 runs in 2h. Status: DISABLED.

Alerted Ramon in #chloebot. These jobs likely timed out (consecutive errors in state) and were being retried too aggressively by the scheduler or internal retry logic.

## 🔄 Cron Watchdog
Ran the watchdog. No missed jobs detected at 5:10 AM.

## Sunday Ritual Email - Decisions Made

### Format Rules (for all Sunday Ritual emails)
- Plain text HTML only (just `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<a>`, `<br>` tags in a wrapper `<div>`)
- 20px Georgia serif font, 1.5 line height
- No logo, no images, no social icons in footer
- No footer course link
- Klaviyo personalization: `{{ person.first_name|default:'friend' }}`
- No em dashes
- Bold key phrases sparingly
- Let Klaviyo auto-insert unsubscribe link
- Sender: "Ramon from All7s" <hello@all7s.co>
- Total links: 1 blog link + auto unsubscribe

### PS Rotation Strategy
- 3 out of 5 emails: reply prompt (no link) — builds Gmail sender reputation
- 2 out of 5: rotate between course link OR social link (never both)

### Klaviyo API Learnings
- Can't PATCH campaign-owned templates directly (404)
- Workaround: create standalone template, create new campaign, use `POST /api/campaign-message-assign-template/` to link them
- Can't schedule campaigns via API (must be done in Klaviyo UI)

### Campaign #1 - Julia Child
- Campaign ID: 01KJJK1K00TE5E498S58ZYT71V
- Subject: "The Sunday Ritual: She Set the Table"
- Preview: "Julia Child didn't become famous because she loved food."
- Scheduled: March 1, 2026 9:00 AM EST
- Blog link: https://all7s.co/blogs/the-sunday-ritual/julia-child
- PS: Reply prompt (no link)
- Ramon fixed the blog link manually in Klaviyo

### Next Steps
- Continue building Sunday Ritual evergreen flow next week
- Need to convert from one-off campaigns to automated flow eventually

## Google Cloud Rate Limit Issue
- Discovered the `chloe-cli` Google Cloud project is on free trial with 10K queries/day limit
- Exhausted daily quota during morning auth issues + afternoon work
- Ramon upgraded to pay-as-you-go billing (from phone)
- Still need to: **Publish app to Production** (OAuth consent screen) to fix 7-day token expiry
- Quota resets at 3 AM EST (midnight Pacific)
- Scheduled one-shot cron to test Gmail after reset
- TODO tomorrow: remind Ramon to publish app + increase Gmail API quota from computer
- FBM sales notifier script + cron are built but untested due to rate limits

## Gmail Auth Fix (Morning)
- Root cause: `gog gmail watch serve` couldn't decrypt OAuth tokens after gateway restart — needed `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` env var
- Old keyring was corrupted; Ramon re-authed via `gog auth remove` + `gog auth add`
- Saved keyring password to `.env` and added `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` to gateway's launchd plist
- Gmail webhook pipeline restored: Gmail → Pub/Sub → gog watch serve → OpenClaw hooks → agent session
- Gmail Pub/Sub watch expires March 6 (auto-renews every 12h via config)
- Manually processed 1 missed Vine order (Leadfan Car Stereo, ASIN B0GGGH3Q9Q, $117.99, row 119)

## Email Security: Tiered Hook Routing
- Created a transform module for Gmail hooks that checks sender domain
- `@goven.com` / `@all7s.co` → trusted session (full tool access)
- All other senders → untrusted session (EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT wrapper, restricted)
- Transform file created and gateway config updated

## Amazon Data Collection Resilience
- 4 cron jobs failed overnight due to Amazon API outages
- Updated all 4 with retry mechanisms: 3 attempts, 10min between retries
- PPC collection lookback increased from 3→5 days (more room for attribution + outage recovery)
- Daily Sales & Traffic lookback also increased to 5 days
- Created shared `retry_wrapper.sh` for all jobs
- Fixed Sponsored Display 400 errors: skip gracefully when no active SD campaigns (expected behavior)
- Reviewed ClawHub SP-API and Ads API skills — our custom scripts are more capable (retry logic, multi-marketplace, SQLite storage)

## ClickUp Integration Fix
- Tasks were being marked SUCCESS in comments but never marked "complete" in ClickUp
- Root cause: script was completing then immediately reopening with next due date — appeared as "to do"
- Fix: just mark complete, let ClickUp's native recurrence auto-create next occurrence
- Batch-completed 12 tasks that had SUCCESS comments but were still "to do"

## #thoughts Channel Setup
- Added #thoughts (C08P1NQBXK8) to Slack allowlist with `requireMention: false`
- Configured per-channel `systemPrompt` so #thoughts sessions silently create ClickUp tasks
- Workflow: Ramon posts in #thoughts → Chloe creates ClickUp task in list 25307274 ("Ramon's Tasks") with smart title + description → reacts with 👀
- Links get researched and summarized; plain text gets saved as-is
- Also created a cron job (every 30min) as backup processor
- Slack bot needed `reactions:write` scope — Ramon added it and reinstalled app

## Email Deliverability Strategy (Gmail Primary vs Promotions)
- Better Hand #1 email landed in Promotions tab for some recipients
- Key decisions for all relationship emails (Sunday Ritual, Better Hand):
  - Use plain text HTML (minimal tags, no Klaviyo templates)
  - No logo, no images, no social icon footer
  - Sender name: "Ramon from All7s" (personal, not brand)
  - Minimize links (1 content link + unsubscribe only)
  - PS reply prompts build sender reputation with Gmail
  - Weight PS rotation: 3/5 reply prompts, 2/5 with one link

## Better Hand #1 Performance
- Open rate: 48.68% (industry avg ~20%, niche avg ~30% — excellent)
- Click-through rate: 6.58% (industry avg ~2.5% — excellent)
- First email ever sent, very strong baseline

## Vine Order Playbook Update
- Updated `playbooks/vine-order-email.md` to never write to column G (ARRAYFORMULA)
- Cleared accidental override in G119

## Google Drive Skills Sync
- Working on syncing skill files to Google Drive folder (ID: 1lBRc1qeU3DPMFifd8bNv9nBhxS6iw6Vx)
- Drive folder wasn't shared with service account — needs sharing
- Plan: bidirectional sync so Ramon can edit skills from Drive

## Sunday Ritual Multi-Phase Workflow
- Redesigned as 5-phase Mission Control workflow:
  - Phase 1 (Thursday cron): draft email + blog content
  - Phase 2: Ramon reviews/approves
  - Phase 3: Revisions if needed
  - Phase 4: Blog + Shopify creation
  - Phase 5: Publish + Klaviyo template
- Seeded topic queue with 10 topics (2 used, 8 pending)

## Slack Bot Profile
- Can't update Slack bot profile photo via bot token — needs user token with `users.profile:write` scope
