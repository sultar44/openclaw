# 2026-02-14 — eBay Nuke & Rebuild SUCCESS 🎉

## Major Accomplishment
**Nuked all legacy eBay variation listings and rebuilt 173 fresh single-SKU listings!**

### The Problem with Legacy Listings
- Old listings were multi-variation (99+ variations per parent Item ID)
- Relisting a parent brought ALL variations back live — even discontinued ones
- Item ID changed on every relist — unstable for tracking
- Complex mess that was error-prone to manage

### The Solution: Fresh Start
1. **Ended all active eBay listings** (nuked the old system)
2. **Created 173 new single-SKU listings** from Amazon data
3. **Each listing = 1 SKU** (no variation complexity)
4. **Track by eBay SKU** (Custom Label) — stable identifier

### Technical Approach
**Data pulled from Amazon SP-API (Catalog Items API):**
- Title, Brand, Color, Size, Style
- Model/MPN
- Material
- Product images (15+ per item)

**eBay listing creation via Trading API:**
- `AddFixedPriceItem` with full item specifics
- Category: 63863 (Women's Scrub Bottoms)
- Price: $16.99, Free shipping, 30-day returns
- All required item specifics auto-populated from Amazon

### Results
```
Created: 173 (171 batch + 2 test)
Failed: 0
Limit hit: No
```

### New eBay Sheet Structure
| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| eBay SKU | Primary identifier (matches FBM SKU minus suffix) |
| ASIN | For Amazon data lookup |
| Title | Product title |
| Qty | Current FBM quantity |
| Price | $16.99 |
| Status | Listed / Out of Stock |
| Last Synced | Timestamp |

**Removed:** Item # column (not needed — tracking by SKU now)

### Automation Added
**New script:** `~/amazon-data/collectors/ebay_sync.py`
- Creates new listings for new FBM items
- Updates quantities for existing listings
- Integrated into wholesale_complete.py (runs after wholesale update)

### Known Exception
- `ALL7S-BRISP5PK-638-130` — Bridge scorepads, not scrubs
- Listed in scrubs category (63863) by mistake
- Future: Add category detection logic for non-scrub items

## Files Created/Modified
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/ebay_sync.py` — New sync script
- `~/amazon-data/collectors/wholesale_complete.py` — Added eBay sync call
- Google Sheet "Ebay" tab — Rebuilt with new structure

## eBay API Key Learnings
1. **Use AddFixedPriceItem** for new listings (simpler than Inventory API)
2. **ReviseInventoryStatus** for quantity updates (fast, batch-friendly)
3. **GetMyeBaySelling** to get active SKU list
4. **No listing limits hit** — created 173 in one session

## Next Steps
- Monitor eBay sync during next wholesale cron run (6 AM/PM)
- Add category logic for non-scrub items if needed
- Consider adding more product images per listing
