## Evening Session

### MCP Investigation
- Installed `mcporter` (OpenClaw's MCP CLI tool)
- Cloned jay-trivedi/amazon_sp_mcp to ~/amazon-data/amazon_sp_mcp
- **Decision:** Skip MCP for Amazon data — our Python collectors already work without AWS credentials
- MCP server requires SigV4 signing (AWS creds), our setup only uses LWA tokens

### 12-Month Roadmap Created
Ramon shared his vision for what we'll work on together. Combined his list with my suggestions.

**Created:** `ROADMAP.md` — comprehensive task list organized by phase

**Ramon's priorities (in order):**
1. eBay connection + inventory sync
2. FBA supply chain automation ("ship XXX to Canada/US")
3. Order projection for China POs
4. PPC/listing optimization
5. Content creation (video scripts, newsletters, blogs)
6. Canasta Q&A chatbot
7. Scoring app (iOS/Android)
8. AI video creation

**My additions (Ramon approved all except profitability dashboard):**
- Review mining (ours + competitors)
- Competitor monitoring
- Local game table finder MVP
- Post-purchase email sequences (Klaviyo)
- Course engagement tracking
- Demand forecasting

**Not doing:**
- Profitability dashboard (has cheap SaaS already)
- Multiple agents (revisit when needed)
- MCP servers (unnecessary complexity)

### Open Items
- Cron reliability still under investigation
- eBay dev access pending (~1 day)
