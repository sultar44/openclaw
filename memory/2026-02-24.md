## SEO Content Strategy Session
- Ramon approved full SEO audit of all7s.co blog articles
- Confirmed boardgamefun.com → all7s.co 301 redirect is working
- Found 20 total articles: 10 under all7s-games, 10 under travel-tales-games
- Sub-agent running full audit (word count, headings, meta, internal links, keyword map)
- Audit report to be emailed as HTML attachment

## DataForSEO
- Ramon chose DataForSEO over Ubersuggest for keyword research
- **REMINDER for 2026-02-25:** Remind Ramon to create DataForSEO account
- Will build a skill around it once account is set up

## Decisions
- All blog/article content to be sent via email as HTML attachments (not Slack)
- GSC + DataForSEO will be the keyword research stack going forward
