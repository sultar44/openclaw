### First Batch Drafted (2-week buffer)
- Better Hand #1: TT-S003 (discard high singles) — Feb 28
- Better Hand #2: TT-S009 (late game baiting) — Mar 6

### Key Decisions
- Ramon prefers drafts sent via email (not Slack) for review
- No images in emails, yes for blog posts
- P.S. rotates: course → social → engagement
- No coupon in Sunday Ritual (pure brand/story)
- Humanizer rules apply to ALL written content (no em dashes, no AI tells)
- 2-week content buffer going forward
