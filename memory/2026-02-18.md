## Daily Cron Audit (5:29 AM)
- 17 jobs, all enabled
- No runaway jobs detected (none with >10 runs in 2 hours)
- Notable: Daily Amazon Data Collection timed out yesterday (600s timeout, consecutiveErrors: 1) — will retry at 6 AM
- Wholesale Pricing had an auth failover error at 6 AM yesterday but succeeded at 6 PM
- All other jobs running normally

## Watchdog Recovery (10:00 AM)
- SQP Retry (Mon-Wed) missed its 9 AM run, recovered by watchdog
- 11:00 AM: SQP Retry (2h overdue) and Rank Collection Retry (1h overdue) recovered again — these retry jobs seem to be consistently missing their scheduled times
- 12:15 PM: Watchdog keeps re-flagging same two jobs as missed.
- 1:16 PM: First fix attempt (after-expected-time matching) — didn't fully solve it
- 1:51 PM: Found real root cause — `get_job_runs()` used `entries[:limit]` which returned oldest runs (API returns oldest-first). Changed to `entries[-limit:]` to get most recent. Also increased limit from 10→20. Verified fix works — no more false positives.

## Evening Missed Jobs (7:35 PM)
- SQP Retry missed 6 PM run — recovered by watchdog
- Wholesale Pricing Report (12h) missed 6 PM run — gateway timeout, could not recover
