# 2026-02-11 — Wholesale Pricing Sheet Complete

## Summary
Completed the wholesale pricing update system with LOWEST_FBA and LOWEST_FBM columns. Sheet now has all data needed for repricing decisions.

## Accomplished
- **Added `getItemOffers` API** — fetches detailed pricing per ASIN (buybox, lowest FBA, lowest FBM)
- **Updated `update_wholesale_sheet.py`** — now populates 9 columns: SKU, ASIN, IS_FBA, MY_PRICE, BUYBOX_PRICE, LOWEST_FBA, LOWEST_FBM, INVENTORY, TITLE
- **Final stats:** 341 ASINs with pricing, 209 products with inventory > 0
- **Cron job updated** — 6 AM / 6 PM EST with 20-minute timeout

## Issues Encountered
- **Python output buffering** — first run showed no output; fixed with `python -u` flag
- **Excessive polling** — burned LLM requests polling for completion; learned to use background execution + one-shot check instead
- **Rate limits** — `getItemOffers` is 1 ASIN per request, so ~15 min runtime with rate limit waits

## Tomorrow's Tasks (from Ramon)
1. **Auto-repricing** — send price updates to Amazon as part of cron job
2. **Inventory reconciliation** — adjust FBM counts when warehouse inventory differs (returns)
3. **Product Master + FBA restocking** — finalize sheet, build restock logic

## Technical Notes
- Wholesale sheet: `1Hc6PBFrSBbAYmtbN_xo0r-DZ6wiDS19bsAKmva_7Q1s`
- Cron job ID: `a64dc8b6-949f-4d7d-a933-a14328879871`
- For long-running tasks: use `nohup` background + one-shot cron check (don't poll)
- Consider using cheaper/local models (ollama) for monitoring tasks
