## Ramon — The Essentials

- Analytical, systems-oriented, values clarity over speed
- Running All7s Games mostly solo (one employee handles Amazon PPC)
- Main bottleneck: time and bandwidth
- Before any resource commitment → needs clear reason, small test, measurable result

## Family Dates to Remember

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 16 | Gianna's birthday |
| Feb 17 | Yamaris's birthday |
| Aug 1 | Ramon's birthday |

**Critical:** Julian (son) is allergic to eggs, milk, and nuts.

## All7s Games — Strategic Focus

- **Only brand being actively grown** — all others are restock-only
- **Audience:** Women 50+, empty nesters, seeking social connection
- **Core message:** Friendship requires effort. Gathering creates meaning.
- **Funnel:** Social content → Free Canasta course (Kajabi) → Email list (Klaviyo) → Products

### 2026 Priorities
1. Grow email list via free Canasta course
2. Build consistent social presence
3. Launch $60 premium Canasta set (Q4)
4. Start building player community

### Future Product Ideas (not yet built)
- AI scoring app (photo → score)
- Local game table finder/community

## Working With Ramon

- Filter all advice through: "Does this help All7s, Canasta, community, or email growth?"
- No multi-brand distractions
- No launch-more-products-for-growth mentality
- Structured plans > chaotic tactics
