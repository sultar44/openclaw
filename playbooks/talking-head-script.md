# Talking Head Video Script Writer — 1 Minute Format

## Purpose
Take any topic and create a 1-minute talking head video script for All7s Games / Ramon's social content. Target audience: women 50+, Canasta players, game night enthusiasts.

## The Formula (3-Step Hook + Body + CTA)

Every script follows this structure. Total word count: **140-160 words** (roughly 1 minute spoken at natural pace).

### Step 1: Hook (3-5 seconds, 20-30 words)

Use the **3-part hook formula**:

1. **Context Lean** (1-2 sentences): State the topic clearly so the right viewer self-selects in. Build common ground by referencing a benefit or pain point.
2. **Scroll Stop Interjection** (1 sentence): Use a contrast word (but, however, yet) to stun them. This is the red light that stops the scroll.
3. **Contrarian Snapback** (1 sentence): Snap them in the opposite direction of the initial lean. The bigger the surprise, the stronger the hook.

**Hook type to use (pick one per video):**

| Type | Template | When to use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **About Me** | "I [accomplished X outcome] using [Y simple method]" | Sharing a personal result |
| **If I** | "If I wanted to [X outcome], I would [Y method]" | Hypothetical / teaching |
| **To You** | "If you're trying to [X outcome], [Y method] will change everything" | Direct advice |
| **Can You** | "Is it possible to [achieve X] in [Y simple condition]?" | Challenge / curiosity |
| **He/She Just** | "[Person] just [accomplished X] by doing [Y relatable thing]" | Case study / story |

**For All7s specifically, prefer "To You" and "About Me" hooks.** The audience responds to warmth and relatability, not hype.

### Step 2: Body (40-45 seconds, 90-110 words)

Deliver **one core idea** with these storytelling techniques woven in:

- **Term Branding**: Give your concept a memorable name. "I call this the Empty Chair Problem" hits harder than "many women lose their social circles." The name creates instant anticipation.
- **Embedded Truths**: Frame everything as already true. Say "when you try this" not "if you try this." Say "the reason this works" not "this might work because." Kill words: if, maybe, might, could, probably.
- **Thought Narration**: Say what the viewer is thinking. "Now you're probably thinking, 'But I don't know enough people to host a game night.'" This builds trust and makes it feel like a 1-on-1 conversation.
- **Negative Frames**: Flip advice into warnings when it hits harder. "This posting mistake is costing you followers" beats "try posting more consistently." Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain motivation.
- **Loop Openers**: After each point, tease the next. "But here's the thing..." / "And that's not even the best part..." Use contrast words (but, however, actually) to reset attention every 15-20 seconds.
- **Contrast Words**: The engine behind everything. Use "but" to split a sentence: lean them one way, snap them back. "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y."

**Body structure:**
1. State the problem or setup (1-2 sentences)
2. Deliver the insight with a term brand if possible (2-3 sentences)
3. Loop opener → give the practical takeaway (2-3 sentences)

### Step 3: CTA (5-10 seconds, 15-25 words)

Soft and warm. Never salesy. One action only.

Examples:
- "If this hit home, drop a ♠️ in the comments."
- "We talk about this stuff every week. Follow along."
- "Our free Canasta course is a good place to start. Link in bio."
- "Save this for your next game night."

## Visual Hook Notes (for Ramon when filming)

- **Text on screen**: 3-5 bold words that capture the context lean. Viewers read faster than they listen.
- **Motion**: Start with some natural movement (walking in, setting down cards, picking up a game piece). Just enough to catch the eye.
- **Staccato delivery**: Hook sentences should be SHORT. Punchy. Compressed. Expand sentence length as you get into the body.

---

## Writing Rules (Humanizer — apply to ALL scripts)

- Use clear, simple language. Short sentences. Active voice.
- **No em dashes.** Use periods or commas instead.
- No metaphors or cliches.
- No hype adjectives or unnecessary adverbs.
- No wrap-up phrases like "in conclusion."
- Banned words: just, really, very, literally, actually, discover, unlock, delve, embark, groundbreaking, harness, illuminate, unveil.
- Write like a real person talking to a friend. Not like AI.
- Vary sentence length. Some short. Some a bit longer to keep rhythm natural.
- **Compress speed to value**: Frontload the best stuff. Anything after they scroll away is a black screen.

## Example Script

**Topic:** Why game nights die after 50

**Hook:**
Most women over 50 have fewer close friends than they did at 30. That's not opinion. That's data. But here's what nobody talks about. It's not that friendships fade. It's that the structure holding them together disappears.

**Body:**
I call this the Empty Chair Problem. When your kids leave, so do the school events, the birthday parties, the built-in reasons to see people. The chairs around your table go empty. Not because anyone stopped caring. Because nobody set the next date. The fix is embarrassingly simple. Pick one night. Make it the same night every week. Text three people. That's it. You don't need a reason. You need a rhythm.

**CTA:**
If this hit home, follow along. We talk about this every week.

**Word count:** ~140 words

## Topic Ideas for All7s

Use these categories when brainstorming:
- **The Empty Chair Problem**: Social isolation after 50, friendship maintenance
- **Game Night Culture**: How to host, what to serve, keeping it simple
- **Canasta Specific**: Tips, history, famous players, why it's making a comeback
- **Connection Stories**: Julia Child, Eva Gabor, etc. (tie to Sunday Ritual)
- **Counterintuitive Takes**: "Game nights shouldn't be fun" (they should be consistent), "Stop trying to make new friends" (deepen existing ones)
