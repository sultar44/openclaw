You hit 125 points, grab 4 cards from the pack, and you're off to the races. But here's the thing: those wilds are worth more in your hand than on the table.\n\nWild cards give you pack access. They complete canastas. They're your most flexible asset. Opening with 4 means you need 3 more for the canasta, and now everyone knows you're chasing it.\n\nMost experienced players wait for 5. Some won't go below 6. The math favors patience here.\n\n**Try this weekend:** If you draw 4 wilds early, resist the urge to meld. Hold them. See how many more come your way before committing.\n\nWeekend game night? 10% off with code CANASTA10 at checkout \u2192 [Shop All7s](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EA384EB6-4C8B-4632-96EC-6E899F61B850?maas=maas_adg_E0710C1268F76A7D58406646A7111714_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas)\n\nWarmly,\nRamon", "status": "pending", "createdAt": "2026-02-27T21:05:00.000Z", "strategyId": "FB001"}

Big mistake.", "body": "Hey friend,\n\nHere's this week's Better Hand \u2014 one tip to sharpen your game before the weekend.\n\n**Do you match every meld your partner puts down?**\n\nIt feels productive. Partner melds kings, you throw yours on. Partner melds 8s, you add yours. Before you know it, you're holding 3 cards and praying for a good draw.\n\nThe problem: an empty hand can't pick the pack. And picking the pack is how you win games.\n\nKeep cards in reserve. Even if you could meld them. Having 8-10 cards in hand gives you options. It keeps your opponents guessing. It gives you pack access.\n\n**Try this weekend:** Next time your partner melds, add one card max. Keep the rest.

They're worth points, sure. But hold too many and you're sitting on a penalty bomb if someone goes out.\n\nThe rule of thumb: never hold more than two aces or two sevens unless you're actively building those canastas. Three aces in hand with no meld on the table? Start discarding.\n\nGood players track these across the whole table. Count what's been melded, what's been discarded. If 6 aces are visible and you're holding 2, those last 2 are gold. If only 2 are showing, your pair might sit there all game.\n\n**Try this weekend:** Before each discard, glance at the aces and sevens on the table.

But your early discards matter more than you think.\n\nHere's the move: shed high-value singles first. That lone king, that random queen with no pair. Get rid of them early when the pack is small and less attractive.\n\nWhy? If someone catches you with high singles when the hand ends, those points hurt. A lone king is 10 points against you. A lone ace is 20. Early in the hand, nobody's grabbing a 3-card pack for one king. Later, they might.\n\nKeep your pairs. Keep your low cards. Dump the expensive loners.\n\n**Try this weekend:** In round one, look at your hand and find the most expensive card that has no pair.

But before you do anything else, scan for a special hand.\n\nA special hand (pairs, garbage, all clean) is worth big points and ends the round instantly. If you're 3-4 cards away from one, it might be worth chasing instead of melding normally.\n\nThe key: you have to decide early. Once you start melding, special hands are off the table. That first meld is a commitment. Make sure it's the right one.\n\nSpend 30 seconds before your first turn. Count your pairs. Check if you're close. If not, play normally. If yes, hold off on melding and see what develops.\n\n**Try this weekend:** Before your first meld of every hand, count your pairs.
