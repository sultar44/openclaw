Hey friend,

Welcome to The Sunday Ritual.

Each week, I want to share one story about a woman who understood something most of us slowly forget: connection does not happen by accident. It is built. On purpose. On a schedule.

These are stories about women who created structure. Who set a night. Who opened a door and kept it open.

This week's story is about Julia Child.

Julia did not become famous because she loved food. She became famous because she invited people into her kitchen.

Before the TV cameras, before the cookbooks, she hosted dinners. She set the table. She poured the wine. She made the invitation feel normal. Expected.

People returned. Not because the recipes were perfect. Because the gathering was.

After fifty, many women stop hosting. Not because they forgot how. Because the built-in structure disappears. No school functions. No automatic reasons to open the door. The table gets quieter. And slowly, so does the house.

Julia understood something simple. Connection does not appear on its own. It is arranged.

She set the table. And people came back to it.

If you have been thinking about starting a weekly gathering, you do not need a reason. You need a date.

Warmly,
Ramon

P.S. Hit reply and tell me — when was the last time you hosted a game night? I read every one.
