# All7s.co SEO Audit Summary
**February 24, 2026**

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working
- All 20 articles have meta descriptions
- Strong word counts (~3,000-5,000 actual content per article)
- Product links present in nav/footer on every page
- Travel Tales blog has good internal linking template (email CTAs, related games sections)
- FAQ article has the best internal linking of any Canasta article (9 blog links)
- 30 Games in 30 Days is an excellent hub page (31 internal blog links)

### 🔴 Critical Issues
1. **8 articles have duplicate H1 tags** — hurts SEO; each page should have exactly 1 H1
2. **Broken blog links** in "8 Players" and "Family Reunions" articles — use `/blogs/nerkin-games/` instead of `/blogs/all7s-games/`
3. **No Canasta course CTAs** on any Canasta articles — massive missed opportunity for email collection
4. **Weak internal linking** between Canasta articles — most only link to 1-2 siblings
5. **How to Play Canasta skips H2** — goes H1 → H3, which confuses search engines

### 🟡 Improvement Opportunities
- Games Like Aggravation has zero internal blog links (only nav)
- Ultimate Guide has 10,700 words but only 3 H2 headings — wall of text
- 2-3 Players article has an empty H2 tag
- Cross-blog linking is weak (Canasta ↔ Travel Tales)
- No FAQ schema markup on the FAQ page (missing rich results in Google)

## Top 5 Action Items

1. **Fix duplicate H1s** across 8 articles (5 minutes each in Shopify)
2. **Add Canasta course CTA** to all 7 Canasta articles
3. **Implement internal linking matrix** (~30 new links needed)
4. **Add FAQ schema (JSON-LD)** to FAQ article for Google rich results
5. **Write "Canasta Scoring Guide"** article — biggest content gap
