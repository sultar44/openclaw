## Background

Born in Cuba. In 1989, his father was sent as a Cuban ambassador to Russia with the whole family. When communism collapsed, the family left Russia by car and went to Spain to request asylum. While there, people connected to the Cuban government tried to take his father. They escaped to the U.S. embassy and entered the United States in 1990.

## Business: All7s Games

Ramon is a business owner selling board games on Amazon and other channels.

### Journey
- Started e-commerce in 2015 as an Amazon reseller (retail arbitrage → wholesale)
- Learned Amazon operations, supply chains, cash flow
- 2020: Stopped wholesale, began building own brands
- Created four board game brands across too many demographics
- Learned that growth requires more than listings and ads — needs off-Amazon marketing, content, brand trust
- **2026 strategic shift:** Focus entirely on ONE brand (All7s Games) around ONE proven product

### All7s Games
- **Target audience:** Women 50+, often married/partnered, empty nesters or close to it
- **Core problem addressed:** Loss of social connection and community after children leave home
- **Message:** Friendship requires effort. Gathering creates meaning. Rituals create belonging.
- **Flagship product:** Canasta Deluxe Game Set ($26 on Amazon)
- **Website:** all7s.co (Shopify)

### Current Initiatives
- Free beginner Canasta course on Kajabi (live ~2 weeks, ~15 emails collected)
- QR code inside product sends customers to course
- Building top-of-funnel social strategy with talking-head videos
- Recording content himself with agency support
- Building email program (Klaviyo) — collecting leads, no campaigns yet

### Product Ladder
- Current: $26 Canasta Deluxe set
- Planned Q4: $60 signature/premium Canasta set
- Planned: Paid advanced Canasta course
- Planned accessories: Wooden card holders, premium card shufflers

### Digital Product Ideas (not built yet)
- AI-assisted Canasta scoring app (photo → score, ~$3/month)
- Local game table map/community (players post open tables, find nearby players)

### 2026 Goals
1. Grow the Canasta course email list
2. Build consistent social presence for All7s
3. Launch premium Canasta set
4. Begin building real player community

### Tech Stack
- Shopify (all7s.co)
- Klaviyo (email)
- Kajabi (CanastaCourse)
- Amazon (main sales)
- Various Amazon SaaS tools

### Team
- Ramon handles everything except Amazon PPC (one employee manages that)
- Strategy, product dev, sourcing, operations, finance, creative, marketing, tech, admin

## Operating Style

- **Systems and structure builder**, not a hype-driven marketer
- Thinks in funnels, workflows, repeatable processes

- Understands structure and logic even without production code
- Interested in building apps/scripts for business + potential side hustles

**Prefers:**
- Structured plans
- Simple funnels
- Repeatable systems
- Clarity over speed

**Before committing resources, wants:**
- Clear reason
- Small test
- Measurable result

## Rules for Advice

- **Only growth focus is All7s and Canasta**
- All other brands are deprioritized (restock only)
- If it doesn't help All7s, Canasta, community, or email growth → not a priority
- No building multiple unrelated brands
- No constant new product launches unless validated by community feedback

---

## Bottlenecks
- Personal time
- Mental bandwidth
- Ability to execute consistently on content and marketing
