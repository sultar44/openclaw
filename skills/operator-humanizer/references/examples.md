## EXAMPLE 1: Blog Post (Full Transformation)

### Before (AI-generated, 87/100 AI score)

Great question! Here is a comprehensive overview of sustainable energy solutions. Sustainable energy serves as an enduring testament to humanity's commitment to environmental stewardship, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of global energy policy. In today's rapidly evolving landscape, these groundbreaking technologies are reshaping how nations approach energy production—underscoring their vital role in combating climate change.

Moreover, the integration of renewable resources encompasses a multifaceted approach. Solar panels leverage photovoltaic technology to harness the power of sunlight. Wind turbines utilize aerodynamic principles to generate electricity. Additionally, hydroelectric systems facilitate clean energy production by harnessing water flow.

It's not just about reducing emissions; it's about transforming our entire energy paradigm. Industry reports suggest that renewable adoption will accelerate significantly. Experts believe this represents a major shift toward sustainability. The future looks bright as we continue this journey toward a cleaner tomorrow. I hope this helps!

### After (Humanized, 23/100 AI score)

Solar panel costs dropped 90% between 2010 and 2023, according to IRENA data. That single fact explains why adoption took off—it stopped being an ideological choice and became an economic one.

Germany gets 46% of its electricity from renewables now. The US hit 22% in 2023. China installed more solar in one year than most countries have total. (Honestly didn't think we'd move this fast.)

But here's the thing—the storage problem is still mostly unsolved. Solar works great during the day, but what about night? Batteries are getting cheaper, sure, but they're not cheap enough yet. I keep coming back to this: we're building a system that produces power when we don't need it and goes dark when we do.

Speaking of which, I talked to a grid engineer last month who said the real challenge isn't generation, it's distribution. How do you redesign a 100-year-old grid for two-way power flow? That's the question nobody's really answering yet.

The transition is happening, but it's messy and uneven. Some places are crushing it, others are barely started. Probably gonna take another 20-30 years to really sort out. (If we're being realistic, which most climate discourse isn't.)

cost me like $6/month on supabase. took maybe 3 hours to set up. (honestly didn't think this would work but here we are)
⁣
now when i write something new, i can search my entire archive. no more rewriting the same thread 5 different ways because i forgot i already said it.
⁣
side note—realizing i've been saying basically the same 10 things for 2 years. kinda humbling ngl.
⁣
anyone else track their content like this or just me?

## Teamwork - Project management that actually makes sense

Most project tools are either too simple (glorified to-do lists) or too complex (takes a week to learn). We built something in the middle.

**What it does:**
- Tracks tasks, deadlines, and who's working on what
- Shows project status at a glance (no digging through menus)
- Syncs with Slack, email, and calendar
- AI suggests deadlines based on your team's actual speed (not fantasy timelines)

**Who it's for:**
- Teams of 5-50 people
- Anyone tired of 17 different tools for one project
- People who want to spend less time updating status and more time actually working

**What people say:**
"Switched from Asana and our status meetings went from 45 minutes to 10." - Sarah K., Design lead

"Finally, a tool that doesn't require a PhD to use." - Mike T., Engineering manager

## EXAMPLE 6: Academic Abstract (Context-Appropriate)

### Before (AI-generated, 71/100 AI score)

This groundbreaking study delves into the intricate tapestry of neural network architectures, underscoring their pivotal role in modern machine learning. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, we showcase how innovative approaches can facilitate enhanced model performance. Our robust framework encompasses multiple paradigms, fostering deeper insights into the evolving landscape of AI research. The findings serve as a testament to the transformative potential of this methodology, marking a significant milestone in the field.

### After (Humanized, 34/100 AI score)

We trained three neural network architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer) on ImageNet-1K to compare performance under different computational constraints. Results show that Vision Transformers achieve 2.3% higher accuracy than ResNet-50 when using equivalent FLOPs, but require 40% more training time.

We also tested scaling behavior: ViT performance improves consistently with dataset size, while ResNet plateaus after 500K samples. This suggests transformer-based architectures are better suited for large-scale applications where training time is less constrained.

The complete training logs, model weights, and evaluation scripts are available at github.com/username/nn-comparison.

## QUICK REFERENCE: Pattern Detection

Use this checklist on any text:

**30-second scan:**
- [ ] Check first sentence for "In today's..." or chatbot greeting
- [ ] Scan for "serves as", "boasts", "leverage", "delve", "tapestry"
- [ ] Count em dashes (—)
- [ ] Check last paragraph for "future looks bright"

**2-minute scan:**
- [ ] Search for all Tier 1 vocabulary
- [ ] Look for "It's not just X, it's Y" patterns
- [ ] Check for vague attributions ("experts believe", "studies show")
- [ ] Count groups of three
- [ ] Look for promotional adjectives (nestled, breathtaking, vibrant)

**If 5+ patterns detected:** Very likely AI. Rewrite completely.
**If 2-4 patterns detected:** Possibly AI or AI-assisted. Fix the patterns.
**If 0-1 patterns detected:** Likely human or well-edited AI.
