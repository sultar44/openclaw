## 📝 Notes

### Effort Estimates
- "Days" = focused work sessions, not calendar days
- Ongoing = recurring task, not one-time

### Priority Principles
1. Revenue-protecting automation first (inventory, supply chain)
2. Revenue-generating content second (marketing, ads)
3. New revenue streams third (apps, chatbot)

### Not Doing
- Profitability dashboard (Sellerboard handles this well)
- Profit OS daily digest (Sellerboard covers it)
- Multiple brand expansion (All7s focus only)
